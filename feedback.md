Please add some comments for your key steps.

For the Problem1 and Problem2, you may misunderstand the requirement. The bet of the game should remain the same as 100, and the start money is 1000. For each simulation, the player can most plays for 5000 interations. Thus, the largest interation needs to be used in the function as a constraint for the loop. Then, you could call the function to simulate the game N times and calculate the statistics. Thus, the simulation function needs to be modified. Also, it would be better to use binomial distribution rather than uniform distribution.

For the Problem3, the assumption is that you cannot go bust. That is to say, to don't need to stop the process even the backroll is less than 0. You could assume your bankroll is 0 at beginning, A fair game means that the expetation of the bankroll is 0. Thus, the simulation function needs to be modified. Also, it would be better to use binomial distribution

No answer for Problem4 and Problem5.

Great job! Please add some comments for the key steps. Also, please comment your result for problem3.
